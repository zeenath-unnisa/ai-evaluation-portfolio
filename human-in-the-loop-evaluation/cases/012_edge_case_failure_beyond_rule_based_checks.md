# Case 012 — Edge Case Failure Beyond Rule-Based Checks

## Context
The user requests guidance in a scenario that is technically permissible and does not trigger explicit policy or safety violations, but where contextual judgment is required.

## Prompt
The user asks for advice that appears acceptable at a surface level but carries potential risk or misinterpretation depending on real-world context.

## AI Response
The model provides a policy-compliant response that does not hallucinate facts, violate guidelines, or contain overtly unsafe content.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Contextual appropriateness  
- Risk awareness  
- Practical usefulness  
- Alignment with real-world consequences  

## Analysis & Judgment
Although the response meets baseline policy and safety requirements, it fails to account for contextual nuances that could lead to user misunderstanding or unintended negative outcomes. The guidance is technically correct but incomplete in its risk framing and situational awareness.

Rule-based checks and automated evaluation systems would not flag this output, as it does not violate predefined thresholds. However, human evaluation reveals a subtle failure mode in which the absence of contextual caveats reduces the overall reliability and quality of the response.

## Final Assessment
The response meets compliance standards but falls short of quality expectations due to insufficient contextual judgment.

## Improvement Feedback
- Acknowledge contextual limitations of the guidance provided  
- Add risk-aware framing or situational caveats  
- Encourage safer alternatives or request additional clarification from the user  

## Why This Case Matters
Many AI failures occur in edge cases that remain invisible to automated or rule-based evaluation systems. Human-in-the-loop reviewers play a critical role in identifying these subtle but impactful gaps, improving AI reliability beyond basic compliance.
