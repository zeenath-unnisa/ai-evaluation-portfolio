# Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation

This folder contains applied evaluation cases demonstrating structured human judgment applied to AI-assisted scenarios.

Earlier cases emphasise problem decomposition, ambiguity resolution, and impact assessment derived from real-world style issues. Later cases focus more explicitly on AI response evaluation, including safety, hallucination risk, and assumption management.

Across all cases, the consistent emphasis is on:
- Clear evaluation criteria
- Written judgment with rationale
- Identification of edge cases and ambiguity
- Improvement-oriented feedback

Together, these cases reflect the type of reasoning used in human-in-the-loop workflows for AI quality, evaluation, and feedback.
