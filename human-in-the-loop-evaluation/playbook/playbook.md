# Human-in-the-Loop AI Evaluation Playbook

This playbook outlines the framework used to evaluate AI responses throughout this portfolio.

## Evaluation Principles

Human-in-the-loop evaluation focuses on areas where automated systems struggle:
- Ambiguity and underspecified input
- Safety boundaries and refusal quality
- Hallucination and overconfidence
- Contextual alignment with user intent

## Standard Evaluation Structure

Each case follows a consistent structure:

1. **Context / Scenario**  
   The situation or prompt being evaluated.

2. **Input or Prompt**  
   The user request or system input.

3. **AI / System Response**  
   The output being assessed.

4. **Evaluation Criteria**  
   Dimensions used for judgment (e.g. accuracy, safety, clarity).

5. **Analysis & Judgment**  
   Written reasoning identifying strengths, risks, and gaps.

6. **Final Assessment**  
   Overall evaluation outcome.

7. **Improvement Feedback**  
   Concrete recommendations to improve the response.

## Why Human Judgment Matters

Many AI failures are not binary errors but judgment failures — incorrect assumptions, unsafe confidence, or missed clarification opportunities. These cases demonstrate how human reasoning complements automated systems to improve reliability and trust.
