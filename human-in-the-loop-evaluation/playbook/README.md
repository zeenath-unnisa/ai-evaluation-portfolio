# Evaluation Playbook

This folder contains the framework and supporting materials used for human-in-the-loop AI evaluation in this portfolio.

## Contents

- **playbook.md**  
  The primary evaluation framework outlining principles, criteria, and structure used across all cases.

- **Supporting notes**  
  Additional documents capturing detailed reasoning, heuristics, and judgment considerations that inform the evaluation process.
