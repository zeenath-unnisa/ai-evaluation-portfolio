Mock angry customer email

Subject: I’m DONE with your service

Hi,

I am absolutely FED UP with your so-called “premium” service. I signed up for your Pro plan two months ago because you promised 24/7 support and “no downtime,” but for the last three days I haven’t been able to log into my account at all.

Every time I try to sign in, I get some ridiculous “unknown error occurred, please try again later” message. I HAVE tried again later. And later. And later. I’ve tried different browsers, clearing my cache, even using my phone instead of my laptop. Nothing works.

Do you realise this is affecting my business? I run an online tutoring service, and all my client information and scheduling is inside your platform. I’ve already had to cancel 5 sessions because I couldn’t access my calendar or messages. That’s lost income, lost trust with my clients, and a HUGE amount of stress.

The worst part? I emailed support two days ago and only got an auto-reply saying someone would “get back to me shortly.” What does “shortly” even mean to you? Because from where I’m sitting, it means I’m completely ignored while I pay for a service I can’t even use.

I expect:

Immediate access to my account OR a clear explanation of what is going on and when it will be fixed.

An apology that isn’t just a generic copy-paste template.

Compensation for the days I’ve been unable to use the service — at the very least a refund for this month, if not more.

If this isn’t resolved within the next 24 hours, I will be cancelling my subscription and telling everyone I know not to use your platform. I don’t have time for companies that take my money and then disappear when there’s a problem.

Fix this.

– Y.


My response

1 sentence summary - User with a two month old pro plan subscription unable to log on to the platform faced with error message - "unknown error occurred, please try again later” message"


Refined version (3 bullets + 1 sentence)

Here’s how I’d rewrite it using your structure, keeping it neutral but richer:

3 bullet points (key facts)

What happened:
Pro plan customer of two months has been unable to log in for the past three days, repeatedly seeing an “unknown error occurred, please try again later” message across multiple devices and browsers.

What they wanted:
They want immediate restored access to their account so they can run their online tutoring business without interruption, along with a clear explanation of the issue, an apology, and compensation (at least a refund for this month).

What went wrong:
Despite emailing support two days ago, they have only received an auto-reply and no follow-up, leading to cancelled tutoring sessions, loss of income and client trust, and a threat to cancel their subscription and discourage others if it’s not resolved within 24 hours.

1 sentence neutral summary

A Pro plan customer who has been unable to access their account for three days despite contacting support is seeking urgent restoration of access, a clear explanation, and compensation for the disruption to their tutoring business.


2. Mock angry customer email – Billing / Refund

Subject: Why was I charged TWICE and still no refund?!

Hello,

I’m writing because I am completely frustrated with how your billing has been handled. On November 28th, I was charged twice for my monthly subscription – two identical charges of $49.99 on my card ending in 4321.

Mistakes happen, fine. But what’s unacceptable is that I contacted your support team over a week ago and was told the extra charge would be refunded “within 3–5 business days.” It has now been 9 days, and there is still no refund showing on my bank statement, no confirmation email, nothing.

I’ve checked with my bank, and they confirmed there is no pending refund from your company. So either your team never actually processed it, or something went wrong and no one bothered to tell me. Meanwhile, you’re essentially holding my money without permission.

I’m not asking for anything outrageous here – just to get back the money you should never have taken in the first place, and some basic transparency.

I expect:

A clear confirmation that the duplicate charge is being refunded.

A realistic timeframe for when the money will appear back in my account.

An explanation for why this has taken longer than you originally promised.

If this isn’t resolved immediately, I will be disputing the charge through my bank and reconsidering whether I stay with your service at all.

This has already wasted too much of my time. Please fix it.

– A very unhappy customer


My response - 

what happened - 
Duplicate billing on November 28th of $49.99 on card ending with 4321. Customer contacted support 9 days ago and a refund of the duplicate amount was promised to be processed within 3-5 business days. 

what they want - 
Duplicate transaction to be reversed with a clear confirmation, preferably via bank statement and a realistic timeframe of the reversal along with the reason for delay. 

what went wrong - 
despite confirmation from support to reverse the duplicate transaction within 3-5 business days, the customer has waited for 9 days and considering to dispute charges with the bank and discontinue our services. 

1 sentence summary - 
9 days ago, the customer was charged twice for the month of November, contacted support and was assured refund within 3-5 working days which is till pending and needs a clear reversal confirmation via bank statement and the reason for delay.


In the original email:

Charged twice on Nov 28

Contacted support over a week ago

Told refund would take 3–5 business days

It has now been 9 days since they were told that, and still no refund

Your last sentence said “9 days ago, the customer was charged twice…”, which doesn’t quite match that. So I’ll adjust it.
