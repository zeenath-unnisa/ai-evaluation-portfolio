# Customer Communication Principles (AI-Focused B2B Support)

## Core Principles
- Acknowledge impact before explaining cause
- Be transparent about AI limitations
- Avoid over-promising fixes or accuracy
- Maintain calm, professional tone at all times

---

## Recommended Language
- "I understand how this affects your workflow."
- "Here’s what likely caused this behaviour."
- "This is how we can reduce recurrence."

---

## What to Avoid
- Blaming the user
- Denying AI limitations
- Using overly technical jargon
- Making absolute claims about reliability

---

## Explaining AI Behaviour Clearly
- AI outputs are probabilistic, not deterministic
- Context, prompts, and limits affect results
- Clarify what the system can and cannot guarantee

---

## Goal of Every Interaction
Restore trust through clarity, not reassurance.
