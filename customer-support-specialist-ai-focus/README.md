# Customer Support Specialist Portfolio (AI Focus — B2B)

This portfolio demonstrates my approach to customer support for AI-enabled B2B products. It focuses on issue triage, customer communication, escalation judgment, and explaining AI system behaviour clearly and responsibly to non-technical and semi-technical users.

The examples in this repository are simulated scenarios based on common SaaS and AI support patterns. They are designed to reflect real-world support workflows rather than fictional narratives.

## What this portfolio shows
- Structured issue triage and prioritisation
- Clear, empathetic customer communication
- Responsible handling of AI limitations and failures
- Internal notes written for engineering and product teams
- Judgment around escalation, risk, and customer impact

## Focus areas
- AI model behaviour and user expectations
- B2B customer workflows and dependencies
- Incident severity assessment
- Support-to-engineering handoff quality

## Tools used
- Markdown for documentation clarity
- GitHub for versioned, auditable work samples

This portfolio is intended to complement a resume by showing how I think and work.
