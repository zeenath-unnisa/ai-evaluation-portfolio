## Case ID
_# USAGE LIMIT WITH QUALITY IMPACT (Case 007)_

## Customer Message
"Since we hit our usage limits, the AI responses seem less detailed.
Is the model degrading?"

## Category
Usage Limits / AI Behaviour

## Severity
SEV-3 (Medium)

## Initial Assessment
User perception issue tied to system constraints.
No actual model degradation.

## Draft Customer Response
Great question — I can clarify this.
The model itself doesn’t degrade, but usage limits can affect context length and output depth. Once limits are reached, responses may be shorter or less detailed.
I’m happy to review options with you to maintain output quality.

## Internal Notes
- Confirm usage thresholds
- Validate context window behaviour
- Recommend plan or workflow adjustments

## Escalation Decision
No immediate escalation required.
