## Case ID
_# USAGE LIMIT (Case 003)_

## Customer Message
"We suddenly can’t generate full AI reports anymore. Is something wrong with the model?"

## Category
Usage Limits / AI Behaviour

## Context
B2B AI product — quota-based access to AI features

## Severity
SEV-3 (Medium)

## Initial Assessment
- Likely usage or quota limit reached, affecting output length or availability.
- No indication of model degradation.
- Initial assessment based on behaviour pattern; requires confirmation against usage metrics.

## Clarifying Questions
- Can you confirm your current plan tier?
- When did you last generate a full report successfully?
- Are there automated or background processes contributing to usage?
- Have usage patterns changed recently?

## Draft Customer Response
Thanks for reaching out — I can clarify what’s happening here.

The model itself hasn’t degraded, but usage limits can affect output once thresholds are reached. I’d be happy to review your usage and discuss options to maintain output quality.

## Internal Notes
- Review usage logs
- Confirm quota thresholds
- Check for unexpected usage spikes

## Workaround (If Applicable)
- Reduce frequency of generation temporarily
- Schedule usage outside peak periods
- Review usage patterns to prevent repeated interruptions

## Escalation Decision
No immediate escalation required unless usage data appears inconsistent with billing records.
