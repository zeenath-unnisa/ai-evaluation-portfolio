## Case ID
003

## Customer Message
"We suddenly can’t generate full AI reports anymore. Is something wrong with the model?"

## Category
Usage Limits / AI Behaviour

## Severity
SEV-3 (Medium)

## Initial Assessment
- Likely usage or quota limit reached.
- No indication of model degradation.

## Clarifying Questions
- Can you confirm your current plan tier?
- When did you last successfully generate a full report?
- Are there automated or background processes running?

## Draft Customer Response
Thanks for reaching out — I can clarify what’s happening here.

The AI model itself hasn’t degraded, but usage limits can affect output length and depth once thresholds are reached. This can make responses appear incomplete.
I’m happy to walk through your current usage and help identify options to maintain output quality going forward.

## Internal Notes
- Confirm usage metrics and thresholds
- Validate plan entitlements
- Check for unexpected usage spikes

## Escalation Decision
No immediate escalation required unless usage data appears inconsistent with billing records.
