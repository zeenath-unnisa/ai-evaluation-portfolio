## Case ID
_# USAGE LIMIT WITH QUALITY IMPACT (Case 008)_

## Customer Message
"Since we hit our usage limits, the AI responses seem less detailed. Is the model degrading?"

## Category
Usage Limits / AI Behaviour

## Context
B2B AI product — context window and quota constraints affecting output quality

## Severity
SEV-3 (Medium)

## Initial Assessment
- User perception issue tied to system constraints rather than model degradation.
- Reduced output quality likely caused by context or usage limits being reached.
- Initial assessment based on reported behaviour; subject to confirmation.

## Clarifying Questions
- When did you first notice the change in response quality?
- Has overall usage increased recently?
- Are shorter prompts or smaller datasets being used now?
- Is this occurring across all workflows or only specific ones?

## Draft Customer Response
Great question — I can clarify this.

The model itself doesn’t degrade over time, but usage limits can affect context length and output depth. Once limits are reached, responses may be shorter or less detailed. I’d be happy to review options with you to help maintain output quality.

## Internal Notes
- Confirm usage thresholds
- Validate context window behaviour
- Identify opportunities for workflow optimisation

## Workaround (If Applicable)
- Simplify or narrow prompts temporarily
- Prioritise high-value workflows within usage limits

## Escalation Decision
No — unless behaviour deviates from documented usage expectations.
