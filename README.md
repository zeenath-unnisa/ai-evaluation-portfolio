# AI Tech Apprentice – Zee

This repository contains my learning projects and practice scripts
as I transition into entry-level AI tech / AI support / AI interpreter roles.

## What’s here (so far)

- **Python basics** – my first scripts (`day1_hello.py`, `day2_basics.py`) as I learn the language.
- **Prompt playbook** – experiments with summarising customer emails and structuring issues for support.
- More to come as I practice logic, data handling, and AI-assisted workflows.
